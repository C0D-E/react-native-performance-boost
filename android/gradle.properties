# Project-wide Gradle settings.

# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:
# Gradle settings configured through the IDE *will override*
# any settings specified in this file.

# For more details on how to configure your build environment visit

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# Default gradle options can be configured from the command line using -D
# Example: /gradlew <task-name> -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
# Conservative defaults - safe for 8GB+ systems, optimized by performance-boost scripts
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m

# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects
org.gradle.parallel=true

# Gradle Daemon - improves build performance
org.gradle.daemon=true

# Configure the build cache
org.gradle.caching=true

# Enable configuration cache (Gradle 6.6+)
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true

# Gradle workers - conservative default for compatibility
org.gradle.workers.max=4

# AndroidX package structure to make it clearer which packages are bundled with the
# Android operating system, and which are packaged with your app's APK

# Use this property to specify which architecture you want to build.
# You can also override it from the CLI using
# ./gradlew <task> -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86_64
# Default: Build for common architectures
reactNativeArchitectures=armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a,x86,x86_64

# Use this property to enable support to the new architecture.
# This will allow you to use TurboModules and the Fabric render in
# your application. You should enable this flag either if you want
# to write custom TurboModules/Fabric components OR use libraries that
# are providing them.
newArchEnabled=false

# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.
hermesEnabled=true

# Performance Boost Settings
# These are conservative defaults that work well with the performance-boost scripts
# The smart-memory.sh script will dynamically optimize these values based on your hardware
